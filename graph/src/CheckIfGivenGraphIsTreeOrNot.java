        An undirected graph is tree if it has the following properties.
            1) There is no cycle.
            2) The graph is connected.

        A directed graph is tree if it has the following properties.
            1) Find the root of the tree, which is the vertex with no incoming edges.
            2) Perform a DFS to check that each node has exactly one parent.
            3) The graph is connected, i.e. make sure that all nodes are visited.
